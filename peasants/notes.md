Implementation Fruch-Gold algorithm. Downloaded the original paper.

Okay I have the psuedo code to implement.

Okay I have some nodes and edges and positions! Next I want to be able to change my positions. Mutable right I guess? So length of positions will be fixed, but I will definitely want to be changing values.

Okay I have a value that changes! I almost surely don't do this very efficiently, but it works.

Positions makes sense. What is disp??? Displacement probably? How much to move the position each iteration?

Yes that is correct.
